Footnote(s): PrEP coverage͵ reported as a percentage͵ is calculated as the number of persons aged ≥16 years classified as having been prescribed PrEP divided by the estimated number of persons aged ≥16 years who had indications for PrEP. Number prescribed͵ or “cases”͵ is defined as the number of persons aged ≥16 years classified as having been prescribed PrEP during the specified year and includes all FDA-approved drugs for PrEP. “Population” is the annual estimated number of persons with PrEP indications. Total includes people categorized by IQVIA as Black͵ White͵ Hispanic͵ or Other race. Race/ethnicity data are adjusted due to large proportion of missing race/ethnicity.

Footnote(s): Data for 2022 are considered preliminary (subject to a 12-month reporting delay). Inclusion of 2022 data in trend assessments is discouraged. Data for the year 2020 should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to HIV testing, care-related services, and case surveillance activities in state/local jurisdictions. Data by transmission category presented based on assigned sex at birth and are adjusted for missing transmission category. See Technical notes for more details on data availability and stratifications.,,,,,,,,
Death data for the year 2021 are preliminary and based on death data received by CDC as of December 2022. Death data for years 2020 and 2021 should be interpreted with caution due to excess deaths in the United States population attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information, see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm. Death data based on residence at death.
